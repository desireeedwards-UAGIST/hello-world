# hello-world
My name is Desiree Edwards and I am from the White Mountain Apache tribe in east-central Arizona.
I am the only GIS specialist working for the Bureau of Indian Affairs Ft. Apache Agency and work under the branch of Natural Resource and Wildland fire.
I am busy with hoping to complete UA GIST master's program this spring.
I am also busy with work like preparing for upcoming fire season by training wildland fire personnel to use Field Maps to map wildland fire incidents.
Work is a plus because I work alongside my husband who is a part of the Ft. Apache Hotshots who respond to wildfires first, usually in dangerous terrain and that makes his job dangerous.
I love spending time and traveling with my two girls and my husband since my husband is very busy during fire season May-September.
I have fur babies as well, three cats who are named Luke, Leia, and Gibby and Pyrenees/Anatolian shepherd dog named Smokey.
